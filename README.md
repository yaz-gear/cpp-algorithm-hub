# C++ Algorithm Hub (Enhanced Version)

## Overview
**C++ Algorithm Hub** is a comprehensive project designed to showcase **advanced C++ programming skills**, **algorithm implementation**, and **modular software design**.  
This enhanced version includes multiple algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph operations, wrapped in an **interactive terminal interface** that allows users to input data and view results.

The project is designed not just as a learning exercise, but as a **demonstration of practical coding skills** applicable in real-world scenarios, such as corporate data processing, automation, or algorithmic problem-solving.

## Motivation / Problem Statement
In many professional or corporate settings, understanding and implementing **core algorithms** is crucial for:
- **Data tracking and management**: Sorting and searching large datasets efficiently  
- **System automation**: Graph traversal for dependency resolution, workflow analysis, or route optimization  
- **Software testing and prototyping**: Quickly visualizing algorithm behavior for educational or internal software purposes  

This project was created to:
1. Provide a **modular and reusable C++ framework** for implementing core algorithms  
2. Allow **interactive testing** of algorithms for educational or professional demonstrations  
3. Offer a **code base for rapid prototyping** in corporate or research projects  
4. Serve as a **GitHub showcase** for recruiters to see coding style, problem-solving, and modular software design
